## In one line

Mid-way through the **v1.0.0 rewrite** — tooling migration done; the new
TypeScript-config API is partly built; the CLI builds and runs again, with only
the `add` command wired so far.

## Active work

- **[0001 — v1.0.0 rewrite](./tasks/0001-v1-api-rewrite.md)** — *in progress*.
  Tooling + new `bluprint.config.ts` API + docs site.
- **[0002 — Actions function API](./tasks/0002-actions-function-api.md)** —
  *done* (docs deferred). 8 actions as typed factory functions + runner.

## What works right now

- Tooling stack (pnpm, ESM, TS, Vitest, Valibot, changesets, rollup v4, Astro docs) — committed in `ca3eb43`.
- New runtime modules with passing tests: [`config/`](../src/config/), [`profile/`](../src/profile/).
- [`context/`](../src/context/) and [`prompts/`](../src/prompts/) modules in place.
- [`add`](../src/commands/add/index.ts), [`token`](../src/commands/token/index.ts), and [`remove`](../src/commands/remove/index.ts) commands ported to the new `profile`/`config` APIs (with tests).
- [`src/cli.ts`](../src/cli.ts) recreated (sade) — **builds and runs** (`add` + `token` + `remove` wired; others pending).
- [`src/actions/`](../src/actions/) — 8 actions as typed factory functions + `runActions` runner, exported from the package root (task 0002).

## What's broken / unfinished

- Commands `start` / `clone` / `new` not yet ported from `__archive/` (not yet wired in `cli.ts`). `start` can now consume `runActions`.
- `actions` (render/copy/move/…) not yet ported to the new API.
- Docs content still describes the old `.bluprintrc` API.
- The v1 changeset text is inaccurate (claims API unchanged).
- Working tree beyond the committed docs system + this session's work is still **uncommitted**.

## Health check (2026-07-01)

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | `pnpm test` (`vitest run`) | ✅ 75 passing (config + profile + token + remove + actions) |
| Typecheck | `npx tsc --noEmit` | ✅ clean (`__archive/` excluded) |
| Build | `pnpm build` (`rollup`) | ✅ builds `dist/index.js` + `dist/cli.js` |
| CLI smoke | `node dist/cli.js --help` | ✅ runs, shows banner + `add` + `remove` + `token` |

## Suggested next step

Port the **`start`** command (task 0001) — the big one. It selects a bluprint
via `profile.promptForBluprint()`, loads its config, fetches/extracts the
bluprint files (needs `fetchBluprint` ported), handles `parts` selection, then
runs the config's actions via `runActions` (now available from task 0002).
Worth its own plan. `clone` and `new` follow.

> ⚠️ When testing commands that touch the `profile` singleton, **seed state in
> `beforeEach`** — mock-fs doesn't reliably reset the singleton's writes between
> tests. See task 0001's blockers note.
